# Java Chess Game 

A fully object-oriented chess game implemented in **Java**, developed as a learning project to practice **OOP**, **clean code principles**, and **game logic design**.  

This project simulates a complete chess match, including movement rules, special moves, and game states (check, checkmate, draw).

---

## Features
- Full chessboard logic with piece movement
- Special rules:
  - Castling
  - En Passant
  - Pawn promotion
- Detection of check and checkmate
- Turn-based player system
- Console-based interface (future improvement: GUI)
- Clear separation of game logic and UI

---

## Tech Stack
- **Java 17+**
- **OOP principles** (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- **Maven/Gradle** *(optional, if you configure later)*
